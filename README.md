The Code Talkers are Native Americans who participated in wars (mainly WW2) on behalf of America, translating sensitive encoded messages from allied headquarters to front lines in their own language, essentially creating an unbreakable code. There were two code types; the type shown here is just the literal translation with each american letter mapping to a Navajo word, with the other type (known widely as the "unbreakable" one) being an informal translation to native tongue and back.

Note: This was made in Java Swing, soley and completely by Terry Yu, and the letter -> navajo translation was found on https://asecuritysite.com/coding/navc.
