The Code Talkers are Native Americans who participated in wars (mainly WW2) on behalf of America, translating encoded messages from allied headquarters to their own language, and back, essentially creating an unbreakable code. There were two code types; the type shown here is just the literal translation with each american letter mapping to a navajo word, with the other type (known widely as the "unbreakable" one) being an informal translation to native tongue and back.
